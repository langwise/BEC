/**
 * Reading the site's own source for every asset it references.
 *
 * **Build time and tests only.** It walks the source tree with `node:fs`, which
 * a deployed function does not have — the result is baked into
 * `src/data/asset-references.ts` by `scripts/build-asset-references.mjs` and it
 * is that generated file the cleanup screen reads.
 *
 * Three kinds of reference exist (see [10]):
 *
 *   asset("documents/naac/ssr.pdf")     a literal key    → collected here
 *   assetsUnder("cells/step/")          a literal folder → protected by name
 *   asset(`facilities/hostels/${x}`)    built at runtime → invisible; the file
 *                                                          must be acknowledged
 *
 * The third kind is why this also reports *where* interpolation is used. A new
 * template-literal call site nobody protected would make ~80 files on live
 * pages look deletable, so `protected-prefixes.test.ts` fails on an unlisted
 * one.
 *
 * A regex rather than a parser: the input is our own source, the output is
 * filtered through `isAssetKeyShaped`, and over-collecting is harmless — a
 * string that is not really a key protects nothing that exists.
