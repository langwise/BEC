/**
 * `content/departments.json` ⇄ the shape the departments editor works in — and
 * the notable thing is how little conversion there is.
 *
 * Every other editor flattens its document into a typed form state and rebuilds
 * it on the way out, which is a mapper per field. A department has seventy-five
 * of them nested five deep, so this editor's state *is* the department object:
 * fields it does not touch come out byte-identical because they were never
 * taken apart, and a field added to the schema needs a widget, not a mapper.
 *
 * Two things make that safe. `normalize.ts` applies the trim-and-drop rules the
 * per-field mappers used to apply one at a time, and the React handle rows need
 * lives beside each row rather than on it (`row-id.ts`), so nothing the browser
 * invents can reach the file.
