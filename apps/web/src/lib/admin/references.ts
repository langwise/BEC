/**
 * Every asset key the site points at, assembled at request time.
 *
 * Three sources, deliberately overlapping — protection is a union, so a key
 * only has to be seen once to be safe:
 *
 *   1. `SOURCE_KEYS` — literal keys in the code, frozen at build time by
 *      `scripts/build-asset-references.mjs` (a function has no source tree).
 *   2. The content files **this deployment shipped** — free, already in memory.
 *   3. The content files **at repo HEAD** — the fresher truth. An Editor who
 *      publishes a photo at 10:00 has changed HEAD, and the deploy carrying it
 *      does not exist for another two minutes; without this read, that photo is
 *      unreferenced for exactly as long as the deploy takes.
 *
 * Keys are recognised by shape and set-membership, never by field name — a new
 * unschema'd field holding a photo would otherwise silently unprotect it ([10]).
