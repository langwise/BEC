// The content contract: one Zod schema per content/*.json file. Loaders in
// src/content/*.ts parse through these at import time (so `next build` fails
// on invalid content), scripts/validate-content.mjs runs them standalone, and
// scripts/build-content-schema.mjs regenerates the content/*.schema.json IDE
// hints from them. Future admin server routes import from here too.
