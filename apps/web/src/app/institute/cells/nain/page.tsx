            <p>
              The New Age Innovation Network 2.0 scheme of GoK is implemented to
              create an ecosystem that promotes innovation in educational
              institutions. Under this scheme, students are encouraged to identify
              local problems, address them using concepts of frugal innovation and
              also develop appropriate technology-based solutions and working
              prototypes. For this, mentors are assigned to students to help them
              formulate a business model and encourage them to think like
              entrepreneurs.
