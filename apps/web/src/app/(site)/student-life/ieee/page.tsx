  "The IEEE Student Branch (STB35261) of Basaveshwar Engineering College, Bagalkot, was established in January 1994 by Dr. Suresh H. Jangamshetti, a Senior Member of IEEE and a visionary in engineering education. The branch, known as BEC-IEEE, was founded with the goal of fostering technical excellence, professional networking and innovation among students, and has since played a pivotal role in organising workshops, technical talks, and humanitarian and professional activities that have shaped the careers of countless students.",
  "In January 2020, the IEEE North Karnataka Sub-Section (NKSS) was officially established, strengthening IEEE's presence in northern Karnataka and providing a structured platform for innovation, collaboration and professional development in the region. BEC-IEEE became one of its affiliated entities under the IEEE Bangalore Section, enabling participation in cross-institutional initiatives, joint events and broader networking opportunities while bringing global IEEE resources closer to its members.",
  "In September 2024, BEC-IEEE successfully organised NKCon-24, an international conference that attracted participants and experts from across the globe, showcasing cutting-edge research and innovative solutions. The event also celebrated 30 years of the branch's dedication to IEEE's mission of advancing technology for humanity.",
  "Today, the IEEE BEC Student Branch is a thriving community driven by a shared mission — to empower students to pursue their passions, cultivate meaningful connections and make a lasting impact.",
